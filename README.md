# How to Contribute?
### **Contribute First, Think Later.**

_If you're not comfortable with command line, [here are tutorials using GUI tools.](#tutorials-using-other-tools)_


<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/fork.png" alt="fork this repository" />

#### If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).

## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/copy-to-clipboard.png" alt="copy URL to clipboard" />

For example:

```
git clone <url>
```

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd DSA_Cohort
```

Now create a branch using the `git switch` command:

```
git switch -c your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```
git switch -c add-vasu-jhawar
```

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now open `Contributors.md` file in a text editor, add your name to it. Don't add it at the beginning or end of the file. Put it anywhere in between. Now, save the file.

<img align="right" width="450" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/git-status.png" alt="git status" />

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add Contributors.md
```
Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Add Vasu to Contributors.md"
```

replacing `your-name` with your name.

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.
